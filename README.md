# ThrowBall ☄️

## Intro ℹ️

ThrowBall is intended to be a common network and class library to be shared among all other microservices in the project. 
The reason behind that is to preserve consistency in the class definition of json model and encoded packets which can be seen under *Models* directory.

THe development is done purely in C# without any extra dependencies.

## Contribution 🧟‍♂️
